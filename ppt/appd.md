• Title: Custom APPD Data Aggregation to User's Tier Name and Tier Node
• Subtitle: Enhance Data Monitoring and Analysis Capabilities

Slide 1: What is APPD?

• Definition: An application performance monitoring (APM) tool used to track and analyze application performance.
• Purpose: Real-time monitoring of application status, identification of bottlenecks, and optimization of performance.

Slide 2: The Functions of Custom APPD Aggregation

• Data Aggregation and Visualization:
    • Users can customize the data aggregation to their own Tier Name and Tier Node.
• Multi-Dimensional Monitoring:
    • Supports monitoring and analysis based on different metrics, time ranges, and custom conditions.
• User Control:
    • Gives users full control and flexibility, allowing them to define specific data to be monitored.

Slide 3: The Benefits of Custom APPD Aggregation

• Improve Decision-Making Ability: Obtain key performance indicators (KPIs) in real-time and make data-driven decisions quickly.
• Optimize User Experience: Discover and solve problems in a timely manner by monitoring application performance.
• Flexibility and Scalability: Adapt to user-specific needs and adjust monitoring strategies at any time.

Slide 4: Implementing Custom APPD Aggregation in GKE

• Step 1: Define Tier Name and Tier Node
    • Users determine the logical hierarchy and nodes of the aggregated data.
• Step 2: Data Source Connection
    • Send performance data from the application to the aggregation service of APPD.
• Step 3: Data Visualization and Analysis
    • Provide an API or interface to allow users to view and analyze aggregated data.

Slide 5: Conclusion

• The custom APPD data aggregation function provides users with a more flexible performance monitoring solution.
• Through simple integration steps, users can customize monitoring strategies.
