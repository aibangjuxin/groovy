• Title: Introducing reCAPTCHA to Our GKE API Platform
• Subtitle: Protect Your API from Spam and Abuse

Slide 1: What is reCAPTCHA?

• Definition: A free tool provided by Google, designed to protect websites from false registrations and abuse.
• Purpose: Ensure that users are humans rather than robots.

Slide 2: The Functions of reCAPTCHA

• Prevent Automated Attacks:
    • Avoid malicious robots accessing the API.
• Verify User Identity:
    • Verify the human identity of users when they submit forms or access specific operations.
• Multiple CAPTCHA Types:
    • reCAPTCHA v2: Includes graphic CAPTCHAs and the "I'm not a robot" checkbox.
    • reCAPTCHA v3: Seamless experience, judged based on the user's behavior score.

Slide 3: The Benefits of reCAPTCHA

• Enhance Security: Effectively prevent spam and malicious behaviors.
• User-Friendly: Provide a smoother user experience through the v3 version.
• Simple Integration: Suitable for various front-end and back-end technology stacks.

Slide 4: Implementing reCAPTCHA in GKE

• Step 1: Create a Google reCAPTCHA Project
    • Create an application on the Google Developer Console and obtain the API key.
• Step 2: Front-End Integration
    • Load the reCAPTCHA script in the web application.
    • Add the reCAPTCHA widget in the forms that require verification.
• Step 3: Back-End Verification
    • After receiving the reCAPTCHA response submitted by the user, send a verification request to the Google API.
    • Parse the verification result and decide whether to continue processing the request based on the result.

Slide 5: Sample Code
```html
• Front-End HTML Example:
<script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js" async defer></script>
<form action="YOUR_BACKEND_ENDPOINT" method="POST">
  <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="YOUR_SITE_KEY"></div>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
• Back-End Verification Example (Python):
```python
import requests

def verify_recaptcha(recaptcha_response):
    secret_key = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    response = requests.post(
        "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify",
        data={'secret': secret_key,'response': recaptcha_response}
    )
    return response.json()
```

Slide 6: Conclusion

• reCAPTCHA is a powerful tool that can significantly enhance the security of our platform.
• Through simple integration steps, protect the API and improve the user experience.
