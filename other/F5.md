## F5 GTM and LTM

F5 GTM and LTM are two different products from F5 Networks that are used to manage and distribute traffic across a network.

* **GTM** stands for Global Traffic Manager. It is a DNS-based traffic management solution that can be used to distribute traffic across multiple data centers or regions. GTM uses a variety of factors to determine the best location for a user to connect to, such as the user's location, the load on the data centers, and the availability of resources.
* **LTM** stands for Local Traffic Manager. It is a hardware or virtual appliance that can be used to load balance traffic across a group of servers. LTM uses a variety of methods to distribute traffic, such as round robin, weighted round robin, and health checks.

GTM and LTM can be used together to provide a comprehensive traffic management solution. GTM can be used to distribute traffic across multiple data centers, and LTM can be used to load balance traffic within each data center. This combination of products can help to improve the performance, availability, and security of a network.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between GTM and LTM:

| Feature | GTM | LTM |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Global traffic management | Local traffic management |
| Location | DNS server | Hardware or virtual appliance |
| Factors used to distribute traffic | User location, data center load, resource availability | Server load, health checks |
| Can be used together | Yes | Yes |

Here are some additional details about each product:

* **GTM**
    * GTM uses a variety of factors to determine the best location for a user to connect to, such as the user's location, the load on the data centers, and the availability of resources.
    * GTM can be used to distribute traffic across multiple data centers, regions, or even clouds.
    * GTM can be used to manage a variety of applications, including web applications, email applications, and database applications.
* **LTM**
    * LTM uses a variety of methods to distribute traffic, such as round robin, weighted round robin, and health checks.
    * LTM can be used to load balance traffic across a group of servers, regardless of their location.
    * LTM can be used to protect applications from denial-of-service attacks.
    * LTM can be used to provide SSL offloading.

这里是一个较复杂的 Gliffy 流程图模板:

st=>start: 开始 
op1=>operation: 操作1
op2=>operation: 操作2
sub1=>subroutine: 子程序1
cond=>condition: 是否满足条件?
io=>inputoutput: 输入/输出
para=>parallel: 并行操作 
st->op1->op2->cond
cond(no)->para 
para(path1)->sub1(right)->op1
para(path2)->io(right)->op2  
cond(yes)->io(right)->end
io(left)->end: 结束

st->op1->cond 
cond(no)->sub1->op2->io->end  
cond(yes)->io(right)->end

op1(右)->op2->sub1->io->end


这个模板包含了流程图的多个要素:

- 开始和结束
- 操作(操作框)
- 条件(菱形框)
- 子程序(圆角矩形框) 
- 输入/输出(平行四边形框)
- 并行(深色框与绿色带连接的框)

并组合成了两条主要执行路径和一条可选执行路径。你可以根据自己的业务流程,通过添加或删除节点、修改节点类型及相连关系来得到想要的流程图。

比如如果你的业务流程是:

1. 操作1 
2. 判断条件是否满足
3. 若不满足,执行子程序1,然后进行操作2并输出结果
4. 若满足,直接输出结果 
5. 结束

那么你可以参考上图模板,通过简单修改得到如下流程图:

st=>start: 开始
op1=>operation: 操作1 
cond=>condition: 是否满足条件?
sub1=>subroutine: 子程序1  
op2=>operation: 操作2
io=>inputoutput: 输出结果 
end=>end: 结束

st->op1->cond 
cond(no)->sub1->op2->io->end
cond(yes)->io->end
