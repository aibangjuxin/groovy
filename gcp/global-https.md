### other
- To bind multiple domains to a forwarding rule in the Google Cloud CLI, you can use the following command:
```bash
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create FORWARDING_RULE_NAME \
  --domains DOMAIN1,DOMAIN2,DOMAIN3 \
  --target-http-proxy TARGET_HTTP_PROXY
```
- 
- For example, to bind the domains www.example.com and www.example.net to a forwarding rule named my-rule, you would use the following command:-
```
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create my-rule \
  --domains www.example.com,www.example.net \
  --target-http-proxy my-http-proxy

```
- The DOMAINS flag takes a comma-separated list of domains. The TARGET_HTTP_PROXY flag specifies the target HTTP proxy that the forwarding rule should point to.
- Once you have created the forwarding rule, you can verify that it is bound to the correct domains by running the following command:
- `gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe FORWARDING_RULE_NAME`

# summary
```
Yes, GCP global HTTPS load balancer supports multiple domains. 
You can configure a single forwarding rule to reference a common target proxy, 
or you can configure multiple forwarding rules to reference a common target proxy.
```
To configure multiple domains for a global HTTPS load balancer, you need to:

1. Create a target proxy for each domain.
2. Create a forwarding rule for each domain.
3. Associate the forwarding rules with the target proxies.

Here is an example of how you would configure multiple domains for a global HTTPS load balancer:

Code snippet

```
target_proxies:
- name: www.example.com
  port: 443
- name: blog.example.com
  port: 443

forwarding_rules:
- name: www.example.com
  target_proxy: www.example.com
  port_range: 443
- name: blog.example.com
  target_proxy: blog.example.com
  port_range: 443
```

Use code with caution. [Learn more](https://bard.google.com/faq#coding)

Once you have configured the multiple domains for the global HTTPS load balancer, you need to update the DNS records for each domain to point to the load balancer's IP address.


这里是一个配置多个域名的全局HTTPS负载均衡器的示例:


# Create a global load balancer
gcloud compute load-balancers create my-https-lb --global

# Add a target pool and health check
gcloud compute target-pools create my-target-pool --region us-central1
gcloud compute http-health-checks create my-health-check
gcloud compute target-pools add-health-checks my-target-pool  --http-health-check my-health-check

# Add instances to the target pool 
gcloud compute instances add-to-target-pool instance-1 --target-pool my-target-pool  
gcloud compute instances add-to-target-pool instance-2 --target-pool my-target-pool

# Create a HTTPS forwarding rule 
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create https-rule-example-1 --global --target-pool my-target-pool --ports 443 --protocol TCP  

# Add SSL certificates 
gcloud compute ssl-certificates create example-cert-1 --domains http://example.com
gcloud compute ssl-certificates create example-cert-2 --domains http://example.net

# Create a URL map to map domains to certificates
gcloud compute url-maps create url-map-1 --default-service my-target-pool
gcloud compute url-maps add-path-matcher url-map-1 --path-matcher-name example-matcher --default-service my-target-pool
gcloud compute url-maps set-path-matcher url-map-1 --path-matcher-name example-matcher --ssl-certificates example-cert-1 --domains http://example.com  
gcloud compute url-maps set-path-matcher url-map-1 --path-matcher-name example-matcher --ssl-certificates example-cert-2 --domains http://example.net

# Set the URL map on the load balancer 
gcloud compute forwarding-rules set-url-map https-rule-example-1 --global --url-map url-map-1


Sure, here are the steps on how to create a global HTTPS load balancer binding multiple domains:

1. Go to the **Cloud Load Balancing**page in the Google Cloud Platform Console.
2. Click **Create load balancer**.
3. Select **Global HTTPS load balancer**.
4. Enter a name for the load balancer.
5. Select the region and zone where you want to create the load balancer.
6. Enter the IP addresses or ranges of the backends that you want to connect to.
7. Select the SSL certificate that you want to use for the load balancer.
8. Click **Create**.

Once the load balancer is created, you can bind multiple domains to it. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Load balancers** page in the Google Cloud Platform Console.
2. Click the name of the load balancer that you want to bind domains to.
3. Click the **Forwarding rules** tab.
4. Click **Create forwarding rule**.
5. Enter the name of the forwarding rule.
6. Select the **HTTPS** protocol.
7. Enter the domain name that you want to bind to the load balancer.
8. Select the target proxy that you want to use for the forwarding rule.
9. Click **Create**.

Once you have bound multiple domains to the load balancer, you need to update the DNS records for each domain to point to the load balancer's IP address.

Here is an example of how you would update the DNS records for a domain named `www.example.com`:

Code snippet

```
Name: www.example.com
Type: A
Value: <load balancer IP address>
```

Use code with caution. [Learn more](https://bard.google.com/faq#coding)

Once you have updated the DNS records, users will be able to access your application by visiting the domain name in their browser.

Sure! Here are the steps to create a global HTTPS load balancer binding multiple domains at Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

1. **Create backend services**: Set up backend services for each of your domains. These services define the instances or groups of instances that will handle the incoming requests. Make sure each backend service is configured with the appropriate protocol and port.

2. **Create a target HTTPS proxy**: Create a target HTTPS proxy that will route incoming requests to the appropriate backend service based on the domain. Configure the proxy with SSL certificates for each domain. You can either use Google-managed SSL certificates or provide your own.

3. **Create URL maps**: Define URL maps to map the incoming requests to the appropriate backend service based on the domain. Each URL map should specify the host rules and path matchers for the domains you want to handle.

4. **Create a global forwarding rule**: Set up a global forwarding rule that will direct incoming requests to the appropriate URL map. Configure the forwarding rule with the target HTTPS proxy you created in step 2.

5. **Configure DNS**: Update your domain's DNS settings to point to the IP address of the global forwarding rule. This will ensure that incoming requests for each domain are directed to the load balancer.

6. **Verify and test**: Once the DNS changes have propagated, you can verify that the load balancer is working correctly by accessing your domains over HTTPS. Test each domain to ensure that requests are routed to the correct backend service.

Please note that these steps provide a high-level overview of the process. The exact configuration may vary based on your specific requirements and the GCP services you choose to use.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.


当然！以下是在Google Cloud Platform (GCP) 上创建绑定多个域名的全局HTTPS负载均衡器的步骤：

1. **创建后端服务**：为每个域名设置后端服务。这些服务定义将处理传入请求的实例或实例组。确保每个后端服务都配置了适当的协议和端口。

2. **创建目标HTTPS代理**：创建一个目标HTTPS代理，根据域名将传入请求路由到适当的后端服务。为每个域名配置代理的SSL证书。您可以使用Google管理的SSL证书，也可以提供自己的证书。

3. **创建URL映射**：定义URL映射，根据域名将传入请求映射到适当的后端服务。每个URL映射应指定用于处理的域名的主机规则和路径匹配器。

4. **创建全局转发规则**：设置一个全局转发规则，将传入请求重定向到适当的URL映射。在配置转发规则时，使用第2步创建的目标HTTPS代理。

5. **配置DNS**：更新域名的DNS设置，将其指向全局转发规则的IP地址。这样可以确保每个域名的传入请求被定向到负载均衡器。

6. **验证和测试**：一旦DNS更改生效，您可以通过HTTPS访问您的域名来验证负载均衡器是否正常工作。测试每个域名，确保请求被正确地路由到相应的后端服务。

请注意，这些步骤提供了一个高级概述。具体的配置可能因您的具体需求和所选择使用的GCP服务而有所不同。
