So you have two BigQuery projects, one for dev and one for prod, and you want to combine the data from both projects to calculate the total number of unique API names for each team, considering both dev and prod environments.

To solve this problem, you can use BigQuery's Cross-Project SQL Queries feature. This feature allows you to query data across multiple projects, without requiring separate authentication credentials.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. Enable the Cross-Project SQL Queries feature in both projects:
	* Go to the BigQuery console for each project.
	* Click on the "Settings" icon (gear icon) in the top right corner.
	* Click on "Query settings".
	* Toggle the "Cross-project queries" switch to the "On" position.
2. Create a new service account for authorization:
	* Go to the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the IAM & Admin page.
	* Click on "Service accounts" and then "Create Service Account".
	* Choose a name and description for the service account.
	* Select the "BigQuery Data Viewer" role and click "Create".
3. Create a new project using the service account:
	* Go to the BigQuery console and create a new project.
	* Choose the service account you created in step 2 as the default service account.
4. Query data across projects:
	* Write a SQL query that combines the data from both projects.
	* Use the ` CROSS JOIN` operator to combine the tables from both projects.
	* Use the `DISTINCT` function to remove duplicates.
	* Use an aggregate function like `COUNT(DISTINCT)` to count the number of unique API names.

Here's an example SQL query:
```sql
SELECT 
  team_name, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT api_name) AS unique_api_names
FROM 
  (SELECT team_name, api_name FROM project-dev.dataset.table)
  CROSS JOIN 
  (SELECT team_name, api_name FROM project-prod.dataset.table)
GROUP BY 
  team_name
HAVING 
  COUNT(DISTINCT api_name) >= 10;
```
This query combines the data from both projects, removes duplicates, and counts the number of unique API names for each team. The `HAVING` clause filters the results to only include teams with at least 10 unique API names.

Note that you may need to modify the query based on your specific use case. Additionally, you may want to consider implementing additional security measures, such as using secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to your data.
