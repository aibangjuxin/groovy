To flow iptable nat packets and get the source IP or domain host, you can use the following command:

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j LOG --log-prefix "NAT packet: " --log-level 4

This will log all NAT packets with a prefix of "NAT packet:" and a log level of 4. You can then check the system logs (usually found in /var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog) to see the logged information, which should include the source IP or domain host.



To monitor the network policy hit log for pods in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), you can follow these steps:

Enable network policy logging by creating a new ConfigMap with the following settings:
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kube-system/network-policy-logging
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  loglevel: "5"
Apply the ConfigMap to your cluster using the command:
kubectl apply -f <path_to_config_map.yaml>
Verify that network policy logging is enabled by running the command:
gcloud container clusters describe <cluster_name> --zone=<zone>
and checking that the networkPolicyConfig field has the enabled attribute set to true.

View the network policy hit logs by querying the Stackdriver Logging API using the command:
gcloud logging read "resource.type=k8s_container AND resource.labels.cluster_name=<cluster_name> AND resource.labels.namespace_name=<namespace_name> AND resource.labels.pod_name=<pod_name> AND jsonPayload.event.reason=NetworkPolicyMatch" --limit=<limit_value>
This will return a list of logs indicating which network policies matched and affected the pod. You can
