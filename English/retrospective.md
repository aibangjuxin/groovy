Ladies and Gentlemen:
 In order to better review the status of our recent work and share our ideas, we have organized the first meeting of the group.
 We expect each member to come to the meeting with an open mind and an active voice. We encourage open communication and frank exchanges, as each of your ideas is vital to the development of our group. Please feel free to ask any questions or concerns and we will work together to explore solutions.
