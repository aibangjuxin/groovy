I checked the xls for detailed requirements. Most of them we have already implemented.
 One thing I don't understand, could you please give me a more detailed explanation?


Hereâ€™s the translation:

"The domains we are monitoring are quite special and currently cannot be resolved through DNS Peering. The domains that our DNS Peering can resolve rely on support from the GCS team and require configuration within the Shared VPC. At present, it only supports domains ending with `abc.com`."
