Half-Year Work Review

I. Achievements
In the past six months, I have accomplished several important tasks. I successfully completed various Proof of Concepts (POCs) and Releases. This has not only contributed to the progress of our projects but also enhanced my professional capabilities.

II. Growth
Personally, I have led the team to understand a large part of the PED workflow and Pipeline-related processes. I have also gained a general understanding of Dashboards and learned some SQL knowledge points. This has broadened my knowledge base and improved my leadership skills.

III. Insights and Areas for Improvement
Reflecting on my work, I realize that I need to think more carefully and find better ways to solve problems in future tasks. I should pay more attention to details and be more proactive in seeking solutions.

IV. Hopes for the Coming Year
In the coming year, I hope to conduct in-depth studies on PMU and Pipeline. I also aim to further deepen my understanding of SQL statements. By doing so, I can contribute more effectively to our projects and enhance my professional level.

Overall, these six months have been a valuable experience for me. I am looking forward to making greater progress in the coming year.
