Updated our gke ingress case

We are now focusing on GKE Ingress. Here are the problems we face:
- 1 We use Backend Service to bind the corresponding rules, and the above error occurs, but this is the solution recommended by Google
- 2 If we use the method of updating the backend service, we can find that gke ingress and cloud armor rule works well, but if we shut down the GKE Node regularly according to the scheduled task, we find that the target is missing



We don't have access yet.
 So we can't start testing yet.
 We need to create a regional level rule permission
 I'd like to know when this permission will be ready

 I'm on the same team as Lilly.

 Lilly and I are from the same team



I queried by reducing the query criteria and didn't see any hit logs


 We focus on the following three areas of testing on our side

 We have now completed this part of the test for the LAN.
 This part of the test on the gateway is basically the same as the one given in the documentation.

2. If we use the updated Backend Service method, we can find that it works normally. However, if we GKE according to the scheduled task key, we will find that the target is lost.'] 
3. If we use the method of updating the background service, we can find that it works fine. However, if we close the GKE regularly according to the scheduled tasks, we can find that the target is missing

Your pronunciation is good, but there are a few areas where you can improve:
- The phrase "GKE Ingress" can be pronounced a little more clearly.
- The word "Backend" can be enunciated a bit more precisely.
- The word "target" can be emphasized a little more.

Overall, your intonation and rhythm are fine. Just keep practicing to make your pronunciation more natural and fluent.

The translation of the sentence is: 
我们现在聚焦在 GKE Ingress 上面，
下面是我们面临的问题。
- 1. 我们使用后端服务绑定对应的规则，出现了如下报错。
- 2. 如果我们使用更新后端服务的方式，可以发现工作正常。但是如果我们按照计划任务关键 GKE，会发现目标丢失的情况。

Perhaps this is an occasional phenomenon.
 We found that long-term shutdown will cause the binding to be lost. If it is a daily scheduled shutdown, it does not affect the corresponding binding relationship. 或 Maybe this is an accidental phenomenon. We discovered that a long time of shutdown will lead to the loss of binding. If it is a daily timed shutdown, it does not have an impact on the corresponding binding relationship. 或 Possibly this is a chance occurrence. We detected that a prolonged shutdown will result in the loss of binding. If it is a daily scheduled shutdown, it does not affect the relevant binding connection.

或许这是一个偶发现象。
我们发现长期关机会导致绑定丢失。
如果是每日计划性关机，它不会影响相应的绑定关系。
Perhaps this is an occasional phenomenon. 
We found that a long-term shutdown will cause the binding to be lost. If it is a daily scheduled shutdown, it does not affect the corresponding binding relationship.
或者这可能是一个偶然现象。我们注意到长时间关机会导致绑定丢失。
如果它是每日定时的关机，它不会对相应的绑定关系产生影响。
Maybe this is an accidental phenomenon. We discovered that a long time of shutdown will lead to the loss of binding. If it is a daily timed shutdown, it does not have an impact on the corresponding binding relationship.
或者这有可能是一个偶发事件。我们检测到长时间关机将导致绑定丢失。如果是每日计划的关机，它不会影响相关的绑定连接。
Possibly this is a chance occurrence. We detected that a prolonged shutdown will result in the loss of binding. If it is a daily scheduled shutdown, it does not affect the relevant binding connection.
